.SH NAME

bppmixedlikelihoods - Computation of site per site likelihoods of
components of mixture models.

.SH SYNOPSIS

.B bppmixedlikelihood [options]

.SH AVAILABILITY

All UNIX flavors

.SH DESCRIPTION

On the basis of a mixed model, bppmixedlikelihood computes the
likelihood of each site for each submodel of the mixture. This is done
with homogeneous and non-homogeneous modelings. If the mixture is
based on several values of a parameter, the site per site a posteriori
probabilities and average value of this parameter are computed.
