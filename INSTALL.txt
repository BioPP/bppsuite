This software needs cmake >= 2.8.11 and a C++11 capable compiler to build

After installing cmake, run it with the following command:
$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=[where to install, for instance /usr/local or $HOME/.local] .

If available, you can also use ccmake instead of cmake for a more user-friendly interface.

Then compile and install the software with:
$ make install

You may also consider installing and using the software checkinstall for easier system administration.

If you install Bio++ in a non standard path (not /usr/), and compile bppsuite with shared libraries,
you must also tell programs where to find them at startup:
-> either by adding the path to LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.
-> or by using RPATHs to hard code the path in the executable (generates NON PORTABLE executables !)
  -> install Bio++ with the "-DCMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH=TRUE" option
