@node Introduction, Syntax, Top, Top
@chapter Introduction

The Bio++ Program Suite is a package of programs using the Bio++ libraries and dedicated to Phylogenetics and Molecular Evolution.
All programs are independent, but can be combined to perform rather complex analyses.
These programs use the interface helper tools of the libraries, and hence share the same syntax.
They also have several options in common, which may also be shared by third-party software.
This manual was hence split into three parts: 
@table @emph
@item Bio++ option file syntax
A general description of the language used to interact with the programs.

@item Shared options
A more detailed description about several options that are encountered in several programs.
This includes input/output of data and model specifications.

@item The Bio++ Program Suite reference
Include a reference of all available options for each program in the package.

@end table

@c ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Syntax, Common, Introduction, Top
@chapter Syntax description

@section Calling the programs and writing the option files.

The programs in the Bio++ Program Suite are command line-driven.
Arguments may be passed as @command{parameter=value} options, either directly to the command line or
using an option file:
@cartouche
@example
@{program@} parameter1=value1 parameter2=value2 ... parameterN=valueN
@end example
@end cartouche
or
@cartouche
@example
@{program@} param=option_file
@end example
@end cartouche
where @{program@} is the name of the program to use (bppml, bppseqgen,
etc.). Option files contain @command{parameter=value} lines, with only
one parameter per line. They can be written from scratch using a
regular text editor, but since these files can potentially turn to be
quite complex, it is probably wiser to start with a sample provided
along with the program (if any!).

Extra-space may be included between parameter names, equal sign and value:
@cartouche
@example
first_parameter   = value1
second_parameter  = value2
@end example
@end cartouche
and lines can be broken using the backslash character:
@cartouche
@example
parameter = value1,\
            value2,\
            value3
@end example
@end cartouche

Comment may be included, in either scripting format:
@cartouche
@example
# This is a comment
@end example
@end cartouche
C format:
@cartouche
@example
/* This is a comment
*/
@end example
@end cartouche
or C++ format:
@cartouche
@example
// This is a comment
@end example
@end cartouche
Command line and file options may be combined:
@cartouche
@example
@{program@} param=option_file parameterX=valueX
@end example
@end cartouche
In case @command{parameterX} is specified in both option file and
command line, the command line value will be used. This allows to run
the programs several times by changing a single option, like the name
of the data set for instance.

Option files can be nested, by using @command{param=nestedoptionfile}
within an option file, as with the command line. It is possible to use
this option as often as needed, this will load all the required option
files.

@section Different types of options

The next chapters describe the whole set of options available in BppSuite.
For each parameter, the type of parameter value expected is defined as:
@table @command
@item @{chars@}
A character chain

@item @{path@}
A file path, which may be absolute or related to the current directory

@item @{int@}
An integer

@item @{int@}, @{int>0@}, @{int>=0@}, @{int[2,10]@}
An integer, a positive integer, a positive non-null integer, an
integer falling between 2 and 10

@item @{real@}, @{real>0@}, etc
A real number, a positive real number, etc.

@item @{boolean@}
A Boolean value, which may be one of 'yes', 'no', 'true' or 'false'

@item @{xxx|yyy|zzz@}
A set of allowed values

@item @{list<type>@}
A list of values of specified type, separated by comas.

@end table

If an option availability or choice depends on another parameters, it will be noted as

@example
parameter1=@{xxx|yyy|zzz@}

parameter2=@{chars@} [[parameter1=zzz]]
@end example
meaning that parameter2 is available only if parameter1 is set to 'zzz'.

Any optional argument will be noted within hooks [].

In some cases, the argument value is more complexe and follows the 'keyval'
syntax.
This syntax will be quite familiar for users using languages like R, Python, or
certain LaTeX packages.
A keyval procedure is a name that does no contain any space, together with some
arguments within parentheses.
The arguments take the form @command{key=value}, separated by comas:
@cartouche
@example
parameter=Function(name1=value1, name2=value2)
@end example
@end cartouche
Space characters are allowed around the '=' and ',' ponctuations.

@section Variables

It is possible to recall anywhere the value of an option by using $(parameter).
@cartouche
@example
optimization.topology.algorithm = NNI
optimization.topology.algorithm_nni.method = phyml
output.tree.file = MyData_$(optimization.topology.algorithm)_$(optimization.topology.algorithm_nni.method).dnd
@end example
@end cartouche
You can use this syntax to define global variables:
@cartouche
@example
data=MyData
input.data1 = alignment(file=$(data).fasta)
input.tree1 = user(file=$(data).dnd)
output.infos=$(data).infos
@end example
@end cartouche

Important note: it is not possible to use a macro with the 'param' option.
This is because all nested option files are parsed before the variable resolution.
Writing @command{param=$(model1).bpp} will not work, but this allows the user to override variables in nested files, as with the command line.
For instance:
@cartouche
@example
#Option file 1:
param=options2.bpp
input.data1=alignment(file=$(data).fasta, format=Fasta)
@end example
@end cartouche
@cartouche
@example
#Option file 2:
data=LSU
#etc
@end example
@end cartouche

@section Setting alphabet and genetic code

@table @command
@item alphabet =
@{DNA|RNA|Protein|Binary|Word(letter=@{DNA|RNA|Protein@},length=@{int@})|
Codon(letter=@{DNA|RNA@}, type=@{Standard|EchinodermMitochondrial|InvertebrateMitochondrial|\
VertebrateMitochondrial@})@}
The alphabet to use when reading sequences. DNA and RNA alphabet can in addition take an argument:

@table @command
@item bangAsgap=@{bool@}
Tell is exclamation mark should be considered as a gap character. The default is to consider it as an unknown character such as 'N' or '?'.
@end table

@item genetic_code = @{translation table@}
Where 'translation table' specifies the code to use, either as a text description, or as the NCBI number.
The following table give the currently implemented codes with their corresponding names:

@multitable @columnfractions 0.5 0.5
@item Standard @tab 1
@item VertebrateMitochondrial @tab 2

@c ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Sequences, Tree, Alphabet, Common
@section Reading sequences

Sequences are numbered as data like this:

@table @command

@item input.data@{number@} = alignment(@{alignment arguments@})
A description of the set of sequence analysed, using the keyval syntax.

@end table

The available arguments are : 
@table @command
@item file=@{path@}
The sequence file to use. Depending on the program, these sequences
have or do not have to be aligned.

@item format = @{sequence format description@}
The sequence file format.

@item selection = @{list of integers@}
Will only consider sites in the given list of positions, in extended
format : positions separated with ",", and "i-j" for all positions
between i and j, included.

@item selection = @{Sample(n=@{integer@} [, replace=@{true@}])@}
Will consider @{n@} random sites, with optional replacement.

@end table
Since Bio++ Program Suite version 0.4.0, the format description uses
the keyval syntax. The format is a function, with optional parameters:

@table @command

@item Fasta(extended=@{bool@}, strictNames=@{bool@})
The fasta format.
The argument @command{extended}, default to 'no', allows to enable the
HUPO-PSI extension of the format.
The argument @command{strict_names}, default to 'no', specifies that
only the first word in the fasta header is used as a sequence names,
the rest of the header being considered as comments.

@item Mase(siteSelection=@{chars@})
The Mase format (as read by Seaview and Phylo_win for instance), with
an optional site selection name.

@item Phylip(order=@{interleaved|sequential@}, type=@{classic|extended@}, split=@{spaces|tab@})
The Phylip format, with several variations.
The argument @command{order} distinguishes between sequential and
interleaved format, while the option @command{type} distinguished
between the plain old Phylip format and the more recent extension
allowing for sequence names longer than 10 characters, as understood
by PAML and PhyML.
Finally, the @command{split} argument specifies the type of character
that separates the sequence name from the sequence content. The
conventional option is to use one (classic) or more (extended) spaces,
but tabs can also be used instead.

@item Clustal(extraSpaces=@{int@})
The Clustal format. 
In its basic set up, sequence names do not have space characters, and
one space splits the sequence content from its name. The parser can
however be configured to allow for spaces in the sequence names,
providing a minimum number of space characters is used to split the
content from the name. Setting @command{extraSpaces} to 5 for
instance, the sequences are expected to be at least 6 spaces away for
their names.

@item Dcse()
The DCSE alignment format. The secondary structure annotation will be
ignored.

@item Nexus()
The Nexus alignment format. Only very basic support is provided.

@end table

For programs that do not require the sequences to be aligned, the
following formats are also available:
@table @command

@item GenBank()
Very basic support: only retrieves the sequence content for now, all
features are ignored.

@end table

Basic operations can be performed on the sequences:

@table @command

@item sites_to_use = @{all|nogap|complete@}
This option only works if the program requires an alignment.
Tells which sites to use.
The @option{nogap} option removes all sites containing at least one
gap, and the @option{complete} option removes all sites containing at
least one gap or one generic character, as 'X' for instance.

@item remove_stop_codons = @{boolean@}
This option only works if the alphabet is a codon alphabet. Removes
the sites where there is a stop codon (default: 'yes').

@item max_gap_allowed=@{percentage|number@}
This option only works if the program requires an alignment. Only
works when the @option{all} option is selected. It specifies the
maximum amount of gap allowed per site, as a number of sequence or a
percentage (detected if symbol @{\%@} is used). Sites not matching the
criterion will not be included in the analysis, but the original site
numbering will be used in the output files (if relevant).

@item max_unresolved_allowed=@{percentage|number@}
This option only works if the program requires an alignment. Only
works when the @option{all} option is selected. It specifies the
maximum amount of unresolved states per site, as a number of sequence
or a percentage. Sites not matching the criterion will not be included
in the analysis, but the original site numbering will be used in the
output files (if relevant).

@end table
 
@c ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Tree, AlphabetIndex, Sequences, Common
@section Reading trees

Trees are numbered like this:

@table @command

@item input.tree@{number@} = @{user|random@}(@{tree arguments@})
A description of the tree used, using the keyval syntax.

@end table

A tree can be declared as given by the user from a file, or to be
random from an alignment number.

If the tree is given by the user, the arguments are :

@table @command
@item file = @{path@}
The phylogenetic tree file to use.

@item format = @{Newick|Nexus|NHX@}
The format of the input tree file.

@end table

If the tree is random, the arguments are :

@table @command
@item data = @{number@}
The number of the data from which the leaf names will used.

@end table

Some programs may require that your file contains several trees. In
this case the syntax is 

@table @command
@item input.tree = user(file = @{path@}[,@{other options@}])
The file containing multiple trees.
@end table



In case the input tree does not specify node identifiers, some will be
generated automatically. Nodes identifiers can be outputed using the
following option:

@table @command
@item output.tree_ids.file = @{@{path@}|none@}
A tree file in newick format, with node ids instead of bootstrap
values, and leaf names with their id as suffix.
@end table

In case it is supported by the program, the use of that option will
cause the program to exit just after producing the tagged tree.


@c ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node AlphabetIndex, Likelihoods, Tree, Common
@section Specifying biochemical properties and distances

Some methods require an "alphabet index" to be specified. Alphabet
indexes associate a value with each alphabet state (Index1, e.g. a
biochemical property) or for a pair of states (Index2, e.g. a
biochemical distance). This section describes the supported indexes:

@subsection Index1

@table @command
@item None
If no index should be used.
@item Surface, Mass, Volume, Charge @{AA@}
Basic amino acids properties.
@item GranthamPolarity, GranthamVolume @{AA@}
Grantham's polarity and volume index.
@item KleinCharge @{AA@}
Klein's charge.
@item ChouFasmanAHelix, ChouFasmanBSheet, ChouFasmanTurn @{AA@}
Chou and Fasmani score for secondary structure prediction. 
@item ChenGuHuangHydrophobicity @{AA@}
Hydrophobicity according to Chen, Gu and Huang.
@item SEALow, SEAMedium, SEAHigh @{AA@}
Solvent Exposed Area, percent of amino acids having a SEA below 10,
between 10 and 30, or higher than 30, respectively.
@item User
A user defined Index1, from a file in the AAIndex1 syntax. The input
file is specified using the @command{file=@{path@}} argument.
@command{file}

@end table


@subsection Index2

@table @command
@item None
If no index should be used.
@item Blosum50 @{AA@}
The BLOSUM 50 amino acid distance matrix.
@item Grantham, Miyata @{AA@}
Two biochemical distance matrices. Both accept an optional argument
@command{symmetrical=@{boolean@}} allowing to specify if the matrix
should be symmetric or not. If not, the distance measure will be
signed.
@item Diff
Allow to compute a distance matrix by taking the difference for, each
pair of state, of an Index1 value. The Index1 to use is specified
using the @command{index1=@{Index1 description@}} argument. An
additional argument allow to specify whether the resulting matrix
should be symetric (@command{symmetrical=@{boolean@}}): if so, the
absolute difference will be used. Alternatively, the distance will be
signed and d[i,j] = - d[j,i].
@item User
A user defined Index2, from a file in the AAIndex2 syntax. The input
file is specified using the @command{file=@{path@}} argument. The
@command{symmetrical=@{boolean@}} argument can be used to specify
whether distances should be signed or not.

@end table

Many models have a set of optional parameters denoted here as
"equilibrium frequencies" that are used to initialize the parameters
of the model related with the equilibrium frequencies. These options
are:

@table @command

@item initFreqs=values(@{real]0,1[@},...,@{real]0,1[@})
The equilibrium frequency is set equal (as much as possible) to the
given frequencies. Those frequencies are given in the same order as
the alphabet, and they must sum 1.

@item initFreqs=observed 
The equilibrium frequency is set equal (as much as possible) to the
observed frequencies.

@item initFreqs.observedPseudoCount=@{integer@}
a peusocount integer added to all counts of letters (or words), when
the frequencies are computed from observed data.

@subsubsection Codon models

Standard codon models: the global @var{genetic_code} argument
describes the genetic code and has to be specified.

Codon models also take as argument a @var{frequencies} option
specifying the equilibrium frequencies of the model. Any frequencies
description can be used here, but the syntax also supports options
similar to the ones used in the PAML software:

@itemize
@item F0: all frequencies are assumed to be fixed and equal to 1/61, 0 for stop codons.
@item F1X4: 4 distinct frequencies are used, with parameters theta, theta1, theta2 (@xref{Frequencies sets}, ``Full'' method).
@item F3X4: 4 distinct frequencies are used for each position, resulting in 9 parameters in total (3 independent ``Full'' frequencies set).
@item F61: free equilibrium frequencies, stop codons set to 0.
@end itemize

An optional option @var{mgmtStopCodon} can be set to define how the
frequencies computed to stop codons in the case of F1X4 et F3X4 are
distributed to other codons.

@itemize
@item uniform : each stop frequency is distributed evenly
@item linear : each stop frequency is distributed to the neighbour
codons (ie 1 substitution away), in proportion to each target codon
frequency.
@item quadratic (default): each stop frequency is distributed to the
neighbour codons (ie 1 substitution away), in proportion to the square
of each target codon frequency.
@end itemize

The same words can be used to specify root frequencies for codon
models, in the case of non stationarity.

It is also possible to setup more specific models, by specifying a
nucleotide model for each position. Model parameters names then take
the form of <codon model name>.<position set>_<position model name>.<position specific parameter name>.

In the following models, the arguments @var{model} and
@var{model@{i@}} are for descriptions of models on bases.

@itemize
@item If the argument is @var{model}, the @emph{same} single site model is

@end itemize

Each single site model is normalized and the substitution rates
between codons that differ on more than one letter are null.

this modification.

alphabet or a codon alphabet.

If the argument is @var{model}, the @emph{same} single site model is
used on all positions (ie the parameters are shared between all
positions).

If the arguments are @var{model1}, @var{model2}, @var{model3}, each
single site model stands for a single-site substitution model. In that
case, all single site models parameters are position dependent.

Each single site model is normalized and the substitution rates
between triplets that differ on more than one letter are null.

Arguments @var{relrate@{i@}} stands for the relative substitution rates
of the sites. Default: @var{relrate@{i@}=1/@{4-i@}}, such that the rate
of each site is 1/3.

@example
alphabet=Codon(letter=DNA, type=Standard)
model=Triplet(model=T92)
@end example
builds a model on codons, such all sites follow the same T92 model.
The parameters names are @var{Triplet.123_T92.kappa},
@var{Triplet.relrate1}, @var{Triplet.relrate2}.

@example
alphabet=Word(letter=DNA, length=3)
model=Triplet(model1=T92, model2=T92, model3=JC69)
@end example
builds a model on 3 bases words, such first and second sites follow
independent T92 models, and third site follows a JC69 model. Then the
parameters names are @var{Triplet.1_T92.kappa},
@var{Triplet.2_T92.kappa}, @var{Triplet.relrate1},
@var{Triplet.relrate2}.

@end table

@node Mixture,  , Meta, Model
@subsubsection Mixture of models

@table @command

Mixed models are sometimes called "site models".

Mixed models combine substitution models with respective
probabilities. We call submodels all the models that are mixed in the
mixture. A Mixed model is either the mixture of several predefined
models, or based on a "simple" model in which some parameters follow
given distributions.

During the likelihood computation process, all the submodels of the
mixture are successively applied on the branches, and the mean (see
below) of all the likelihoods is computed.

A site can follow given paths all along the tree, with given
probabilities. 

In homogeneous reconstruction, a path corresponds to a same submodel
on all the branches, in a stationary condition. The probability of a
path is the probability of its submodel. Given a site follows a path,
a likelihood can be computed; and the overall likelihood on this site
is the mean of these likelihoods (given the probabilities of the
paths). This means that the root distribution is a mixture of the
equilibrium distributions of the submodels.

With nonhomogeneous reconstruction, several models are applied on the
tree, some models are mixed, some are not. A path is a vector which
size is the number of mixed models (see below for more details and the
declaration of paths). 

Since the attribution of a submodel from a mixed model to a given site
is a unique random variable, affecting the same mixed model to a set
of branches S means that the attribution to this site is the same on
all the branches of S. If model M=(Ma,Mb,Mc) is defined on a set of
branches S, a site in constrained to follow either Ma on all S, or Mb
on all S, or Ms on all S. If we want that two branches of S are
independant, two similar mixed models must be defined. Moreover, it is
possible to define paths that define dependencies between submodels of
different mixtures (see below).


@item MixedModel(model=@{model description@})
Mixture model from a given @var{model} in which some parameters follow
a probabilistic distribution. Any discrete distribution available can
be used @xref{Discrete distributions}. The description of the
parameters distributions is described below.

@example
model=MixedModel(model=TN93(kappa1=Gamma(n=4,alpha=3,beta=1),\
                            kappa2=Exponential(lambda=2),\

Mixture model built from several @var{models}: each model has its own
probability and rate. 

Arguments @var{relproba@{i@}} stands for the relative probability and
@var{relrate@{i@}} stands for the relative rate of each model (in the

@end table

@c @subsubsection Paths among non-homogeneous mixture models

@c To define constraints for sites between submodels, we can set "paths"
@c that any site must follow. For example, in the following description:

@c @example
@c nonhomogeneous = general
@c nonhomogeneous.number_of_models = 3

@c model1=T92()
@c model2=MixedModel(model=T92(kappa=Simple(values=(4,10,20),probas=(0.1,0.5,0.4))))
@c model3=MixedModel(model=TN93(theta1=Simple(values=(0.1,0.5,0.9),probas=(0.3,0.2,0.5))))

@c model1.nodes_id=0:1
@c model2.nodes_id=2:3
@c model3.nodes_id=4:5
@c @end example

@c In this case, on branches 2 & 3 a site follows any submodel of model 2
@c (but the same submodel on both branches), and on branches 4 & 5, a
@c site follows any submodel of model  3 (the same on both branches as
@c well).  But there is no constraint between models 2 & 3, which means
@c that a site can follow any submodel of model 2 and any submodel of
@c model 3.

@c If the user wants that a site with @var{T92.kappa=4} in model 2 has
@c @var{TN93.theta1=0.1} in model 3, that a site with @var{T92.kappa=10}
@c in model 2 has @var{TN93.theta1=0.9} in model 3, and that other cases
@c are free (in this case it means that @var{T92.kappa=20} in model 2 is
@c linked with @var{TN93.theta1=0.5} in model 3), then we can use the
@c declarations:

@c @example
@c site.number_of_paths=2
@c site.path1=model2[T92.kappa_1] & model3[TN93.theta1_2]
@c site.path2=model2[T92.kappa_2] & model3[TN93.theta1_3]
@c @end example

@c The third path (for the remaining submodels) is automatically
@c computed.

@c It is possible to link mixtures of submodels. For example,

@c @example 
@c site.path1=model2[T92.kappa_1] & model3[TN93.theta1_2] & model3[TN93.theta1_3]
@c @end example

@c means that a site that has @var{T92.kappa=4} in model2 has either
@c @var{TN93.theta1=0.5} or @var{TN93.theta1=0.9} in model3.


@c Because of these constraints, the probabilities of the submodels are
@c linked. In the first example, probability of @var{T92.kappa=4} in
@c model 2 equals the probability of @var{TN93.theta1=0.5} in model 3.
@c Since it is contradictory with the probabilities defined in models 2
@c or 3, the reference probabilities are the ones of the first numbered
@c mixed model, here model 2. In this case, the probabilities in model 3
@c may have no use, but with the second example the probability of
@c submodel T92.kappa=4 equals the sum of the probabilities of submodels
@c TN93.theta1=0.5 or TN93.theta1=0.9. The relative proportion of those
@c models used in the declaration of model 3 is then used. Here their
@c respective probabilities are then: 0.1*0.2/ (0.2+0.5)=0.0286 and
@c 0.1*0.5/(0.2+0.5)=0.0714.

@c Concerning the optimization procedure, this choice may entail the non-
@c identifiability of several parameters (here the probabilities in model
@c 3), so the user should be careful about this. 

@c Another example in the case of mixtures of mixed models, where the
@c submodels are defined by their names;

@c @example
@c nonhomogeneous = general
@c nonhomogeneous.number_of_models = 2

@c model1=LLG08_UL2()
@c model2=LLG08_UL3()

@c site.number_of_paths=2
@c site.path1=model1[LLG08_UL2.M2] & model2[LLG08_UL3.Q1]
@c site.path2=model1[LLG08_UL2.M1] & model2[LLG08_UL3.Q2] & model2[LLG08_UL3.Q3]
@c @end example

@c When nonhomogeneity option is @option{one_per_branch}, each site is
@c constrained to follow the same submodel from leaves to root.

@node  Root, FrequenciesSet, Model, Likelihoods
@subsection Setting up the root frequencies

Several root frequencies can be defined in the following way:

@table @command
@item root_freq@{number@}=@{frequency set description@}
@end table

The Frequencies set used can be any of the ones described below
@xref{Frequencies sets}, depending on the alphabet used.


@node FrequenciesSet, Rates, Root, Likelihoods
@subsection Declaring frequencies sets
@anchor{Frequencies sets}

The following frequencies distributions are available:

@table @command

@item Fixed()
All frequencies are fixed to their initial value and are not
estimated. 

@item GC(theta=@{real]0,1[@})
For nucleotides only, set the G content equal to the C content.

@item Full(theta1=@{real]0,1[@}, theta2=@{real]0,1[@}, ..., thetaN=@{real]0,1[@})
Full parametrization. Contains N free parameters, where N is equal to
the size of the alphabet - 1. For codon models, N is the size of the
alphabet - 1 - the number of stop codons, whose frequencies are set to
0. For nucleotide sequences, theta is the GC content, theta1 is the
proportion of A over A+T, and theta2 is the proportion of G over G+C.

@item Word(frequency=@{frequency set description@})

or 

@item Word(frequency1=@{frequency set description@}, frequency2=@{frequency set description@}, ..., frequencyn=@{frequency set description@})

frequencies on words computed as the product of frequencies on the
letters. The arguments @var{frequency} and @var{frequency@{i@}} are
for descriptions of frequency sets on single sites such as nucleotides
or proteins. The alphabet must be a Word alphabet.

If the argument is @var{frequency}, the number of multiplied single
site frequencies is the length of the words in the alphabet, and the
@emph{same} single site frequency set is used (ie the parameters are
shared between all positions).

If the arguments are @var{frequency1}, ..., @var{frequency@{n@}}, the
length of the words in the alphabet must be @var{n}, and all single
site frequency sets are independent. In that case, all single site
frequency set parameters are position dependent.

@example
alphabet=Word(letter=DNA,length=4)
Word(frequency=GC())
@end example
builds a frequency set on 4 bases words, such that all sites
frequencies follow the same GC frequency set model. The parameter
name is @var{1234_GC.theta}.

@example
alphabet=Word(letter=DNA,length=4)
Word(frequency1=GC(),frequency2=GC(),frequency3=Fixed(),\
                      frequency4=Full())
@end example
builds a frequency set on 4 bases words, such first and second sites
follow independent GC frequency sets, third site follows a Fixed
frequency set, and fourth site follows a Full frequency set. Then the
parameters names are @var{1_GC.theta},
@var{2_GC.theta}, @var{4_Full.theta_1},
@var{4_Full.theta_2}, @var{4_Full.theta_3}.

@item Codon(frequency=@{frequency set description@})

or 

@item Codon(frequency1=@{frequency set description@}, frequency2=@{frequency set description@}, frequency3=@{frequency set description@})

frequencies on codons computed as the product of frequencies on the
letters, with stop codon frequencies set to zero. The arguments
@var{frequency} and @var{frequency@{i@}} are for descriptions of
frequency sets on nucleotides. The alphabet must be a Codon alphabet.

If the argument is @var{frequency}, the @emph{same} single site
frequency set is used (ie the parameters are shared between all
positions).

If the arguments are @var{frequency1}, @var{frequency2},
@var{frequency3}, all single site frequency sets are independent. In
that case, all single site frequency set parameters are position
dependent.

@example
alphabet=Codon(letter=DNA, type=Standard)
Codon(frequency=GC())
@end example
builds a frequency set on codons, such that all sites frequencies
follow the same GC frequency set model. The parameter name is
@var{123_GC.theta}.

@example
alphabet=Codon(letter=DNA, type=Standard)
Codon(frequency1=GC(),frequency2=GC(),frequency3=Fixed())
@end example

builds a frequency set on codons, such that first and second sites
follow independent GC frequency sets, third site follows a Fixed
frequency set. Then the parameters names are @var{1_GC.theta},
@var{2_GC.theta}.


Predefined codon frequencies are available, with a syntax similar to
the one used in the PAML software. See above Codon Models section.

@end table

All functions accept the following arguments, that take priority over
the parameter specification:

@table @command

@item init=@{balanced,observed@}
Set all frequencies to the same value, or to their observed counts.

@item observedPseudoCount=@{integer@}
If the frequencies are set from observed counts, a pseudoCount is
added to all the counts.

@item values=(@{vector<double>@})
Explicitly set all frequencies manually. The size of the input vector
should equal the number of resolved states in the alphabet, be in
alphabetical order of states, and sum to one.

@end table

@node Rates, Process, FrequenciesSet, Likelihoods
@subsection Setting up substitution rates

Rate distributions are defined in the following way:
@table @command

@item rate@{number@} = @{rate distribution description@}

@end table

The rate distribution is set to have a mean of 1.
The following distributions are currently available:

@table @command

@item Constant
Uses a constant rate across sites.

@item Gamma(n=@{int>=2@}, alpha=@{float>0@})
A discretized gamma distribution of rates, with @var{n} classes, and a
given shape, with mean 1 (scale=shape).

@item Invariant(dist=@{rate distribution description@}, p=@{real[0,1]@})
A composite distribution allowing a special class of invariant site,
with a probability @var{p}.

@end table

@node  Process, Phylo-likelihoods, Rates, Likelihoods
@subsection Setting up the process

Substitution process are numbered like this:

@table @command

@item process@{number@} = @{Homogeneous|OnePerBranch@}(tree=@{number@}, model=@{number@}, rate=@{number@} [, root_freq=@{number@}])

@item process@{number@} = @{NonHomogeneous@}(tree=@{number@}, model@{number@}=@{number@}, model@{number@}.nodes_id=(@{number@},...,@{number@}), rate=@{number@} [, root_freq=@{number@}]) 

@end table

The @command{Homogeneous} type is used for homogeneous process. The
@command{OnePerBranch} type is used for setting branch models (for
instance Galtier and Gouy 97 for branch GC content, or PAML branch
model), and the @command{NonHomogeneous} type for the more general
case, including PAML clade models.

With @command{NonHomogeneous} option, several models can be declared
in the process, using successive model index (starting with 1), and
assigning specific nodes id to each model. For example:

@example
process=NonHomogeneous(tree=1, model1=3, model1.nodes_id=(0:2,4,7:8), model2=5, model2.nodes_id=(3,5,6), rate=1, root_freq=2)
@end example

If @option{root_freq} is not declared, the process is assumed
stationary. In case of non-homogeneity, the used root frequencies is
the equilibrium frequency of the first model. When this model is a
mixture model, since there is not a set of equilibrium frequencies,
the root frequencies are set to be the average (with the respective
probabilities of the submodels) of the equilibrium frequencies of the
submodels.

When the rate is discretized in several substitution classes, a
specific class can be as the rate of the process.

For example, here is the declaration of a stationary non-homogeneous
process in which the rate is the second discrete value of the
discretized gamma distribution.

@example
rate_distribution1 = Gamma(n=4)

process2=NonHomogeneous(model1=1,model1.nodes_id=(1:4,6:9),model2=2,model2.nodes_id=5,tree=2,rate=1.2)
@end example

Note : @command{OnePerBranch} type is not implemented yet. Just ask
the developpers.

@c @item nonhomogeneous_one_per_branch.shared_parameters = @{list<chars>@}
@c List the names of the parameters that are shared by all branches.
@c In Galtier & Gouy model, that would be @var{T92.kappa}, since only the theta parameter is branch-specific.

@c The '*' wildcard can be used, as in @command{*theta*} for all the
@c parameters whose name has @command{theta} in it.


@node Phylo-likelihoods, Linking, Process, Likelihoods
@subsection Setting up phylo-likelihoods


A phylo-likelihood is an object defined by a data and a (or several)
process, making it possible to compute a likelihood. When several
process are used on a data to compute, the resulting likelihood is
computed from a probabilistic combination of this process : they can
be linked in a markovian way, or independant.

Several processes (aka model specifications and trees) can be used
together in a mixture -- aka site-like -- modelling.

@table @command
@item phylo@{number@}=@{Single@}(data=@{number@}, process=@{number@})
@item phylo@{number@}=@{Mixture|HMM|AutoCorr@}(data=@{number@}, process=(@{numbers@}), probas=(@{numbers@}))
@end table


@table @command
@item Single(data=@{number@}, process=@{number@})
The likelihood is computed on a data, given a single process.

@item Mixture([probas=(@{vector of process probabilities@})])
Each process has its own a priori probability; all probabilities can
be given as a vector (must sum one). The likelihood on a site is
independent of other sites, and is the average value of the
likelihoods of all processes, given their a priori probabilities.

@item AutoCorr([probas=(@{vector of autocorrelation probabilities@})])

Along the sequence, the processes are autocorrelated, which makes the
whole process (along sites and time) an Hidden Markov Model, where the
transition probilities from a specific process to the other ones are
equal. The likelihood on a site is computed using the forward
algorithm of HMM modelling. The within process transition
probabilities can be given as a vector.

@item HMM([probas=(@{vector of (@{vector of process transition probabilities@})@})])

The probabilities of the processes on the sites are dependent in a
markovian way, which makes the whole process (along sites and time) an
Hidden Markov Model. The likelihood on a site is computed using the
forward algorithm of HMM modelling. The transition probabilities can
be given as a vector of lines of the transition matrix, each being
given as a vector.

@end table

When several phylo-likelihoods are declared, the computed (and
optimized) log-likelihood is the sum of the log-likelihoods of all
these phylo-likelihoods.


@node Linking,  , Phylo-likelihoods, Likelihoods
@subsection Linking parameters

It is possible to reduce the parameter space by putting extra
constraints on parameters, using for instance

@example
model=TN93(kappa1=1.0, kappa2=kappa1, theta=0.5)
@end example

In that particular case the resulting model is strictly equivalent to
the HKY85 model. This syntax however allows to define a larger set of
models.

As long as their range match, parameters of several objects (models,
root frequencies, rates, etc) can be linked.

For instance:
@example
model1 = T92(theta=GC.theta, kappa=3)
model2 = T92(theta=0.39, kappa=T92.kappa_1)
@end example

Parameters can be linked between objects in the usual way (see
@pxref{Linking}), or using @command{likelihood.alias}, for example to
linked branch lengths.

@example
likelihood.alias= BrLen3_2-> BrLen0_1, BrLen3_2-> BrLen1_1
@end example

where each alias is described as `param1->param2'. The full name of
the parameters have to be used, see for example:

@example
model1 = T92(theta=0.4, kappa=4)
model2 = GTR(theta=0.4, a = 1.1, b=0.4, c=0.4, d=0.25, e=0.1)
likelihood.alias=GTR.theta1_2->T92.theta1_1
@end example

This option can be used to link parameters of the root frequencies:

@example
model1=GTR(theta1=0.7)
root_freq1=Full(init=balanced)
likelihood.alias=Full.theta1_1->GTR.theta1_1
@end example

@table @command
@item None
No optimization is performed, initial values are kept ``as is''.

@item FullD(derivatives=@{Newton|Gradient@})
Full-derivatives method. Branch length derivatives are computed

using the Brent method in one dimension. The algorithm then loops over
all parameters until convergence. The @var{nstep} arguments allow to
specify a number of progressive steps to perform during optimization.
If @option{nstep=3} and @option{precision=E-6}, a first optimization
with @option{precision=E-2}, will be performed, then a round with
@option{precision} set to E-4 and finally @option{precision} will be

name, for instance K80.kappa, TN93.theta, GTR.a, Gamma.alpha, etc. For
nested models, the syntax is the following:
@command{G01.rdist_Gamma.alpha}, @command{TS98.model_T92.kappa},

@section BppML: Bio++ Maximum Likelihood

The BppML program uses the common syntax introduced in the previous section for setting the alphabet, loading the sequences (@pxref{Sequences}), specifying the model (@pxref{Model}), and estimating parameters (@pxref{Estimation}).

The BppML program allows you to optimize tree topologies and model parameters and perform a bootstrap analysis.

@subsection Branch lengths initial values

@table @command

@item init.tree = @{user|random@}
Set the method for the initial tree to use.
The @option{user} option allows you to use an existing file using the method described in the Common options section.
This file may have been built using another method like neighbor joining or parsimony for instance.
The @option{random} option picks a random tree, which is handy to test convergence.
This may however slows down significantly the optimization process.

@item init.brlen.method = @{method description@}
Set how to initialize the branch lengths.
Available methods include:

@table @command

@item Input(midpoint_root_branch=@{boolean@})
Keep initial branch lengths as is. Additional argument specifies if the root position should be moved to the midpoint position of the branch containing it. 

@item Equal(value=@{float>0@})
Set all branch lengths to the same value, provided as argumemt.

@item Clock
Coerce to a clock tree.

@item Grafen(height=@{@{real>0@}|input@}, rho = @{real>0@})
Uses Grafen's method to compute branch lengths.
In Grafen's method, each node is given a weight equal to the number of underlying leaves.
The length of each branch is then computed as the difference of the weights of the connected nodes, and further divided by the number of leaves in the tree.
The height of all nodes are then raised to the power of 'rho', a user specified value.
The tree is finally scaled to match a given total height, which can be the original one (@option{height=input}), or fixed to a certain value (usually @option{height=1}).
A value of rho=0 provides a star tree, and the greater the value of rho, the more recent the inner nodes. 

@end table

@item input.tree.check_root = @{boolean@}
Tell if the input tree should be checked regarding to the presence of a root. If set to yes (the default), rooted trees will be unrooted if a homogenous model is used.
If not, a rooted tree will be fitted, which can lead to optimization issues in most cases. Use the non default option with care!
@end table

@subsection Topology optimization

@table @command

@item optimization.topology = @{boolean@}
Enable the tree topology estimation.

@item optimization.topology.algorithm = @{NNI@}
Algorithm to use for topology estimation: only NNI available for now.

@item optimization.topology.algorithm_nni.method = @{fast|better|phyml@}
Set the NNI method to use.
@option{fast}: test sequentially all NNI, if a NNI improving the likelihood is found, it is performed.
@option{better}: test all possible NNIs, do the one with the biggest likelihood increase.
@option{phyml}: test all possible NNIs, try doing all the improving ones.
If the final likelihoods is better, perform all NNIs.
Otherwise, try to do half of them, and so on. 
In most cases the @option{phyml} option shows the best performance.

@item optimization.topology.nstep = @{int>0@}
Number of phyml topology movement steps before re-optimizing parameters.

@item optimization.topology.numfirst = @{boolean@}
Shall we estimate parameters before looking for topology movements?

@item optimization.topology.tolerance.before = @{real>0@}
Tolerance for the prior-topology estimation.
The tolerance numbers should not be too low, in order to save computation time and also for a better topology estimation.
The @option{optimization.tolerance} parameter will be used for the final optimization of numerical parameters (see Common options).

@item optimization.topology.tolerance.during = 100
Tolerance for the during-topology estimation

@item optimization.scale_first = no
Shall we first scale the tree before optimizing parameters?

@item optimization.scale_first.tolerance = @{double@}
The convergence criterion to achieve in the optimization.

@end table


@subsection Molecular clock

BppML can also optimize branch lengths with a molecular clock:

@table @command

@item optimization.clock=@{no|global@}
Tell if a molecular clock should be assumed.
Topology estimation is not possible with a clock constraint.

@end table


@subsection Output results

@table @command

@item output.infos = @{@{path@}|none@}
Alignment information log file (site specific rates, etc):

@item output.estimates = @{@{path@}|none@}
Write numerical parameter estimated values.

@end table

@subsection Bootstrap analysis

@table @command

@item bootstrap.number = @{int>0@}
Number of replicates. A reasonable value would be >= 100.

@item bootstrap.approximate = @{boolean@}
Tell if numerical parameters should be kept to their initial value when bootstrapping. 

@item bootstrap.verbose = @{boolean@}
Set this to yes for detailed output when bootstrapping. 

@item bootstrap.output.file = @{@{path@}|none@}
Where to write the resulting trees (multi-trees newick format).

@end table

@subsection Rather technical options

Theses options are mainly for debugging or testing purpose, in most case you will be happy with the default setting.

@table @command

@item likelihood.recursion = @{simple|double@}
Set the type of likelihood recursion to use.
@option{simple}: derivatives take more time to compute, but likelihood computation is faster.
For big data sets, it can save a lot of memory usage too, particularly when the data are compressed.
@option{double}: uses more memory and need more time to compute likelihood, due to the double recursion.
Analytical derivatives are however faster to compute.

This command has no effect in the following cases: (i) topology estimation: this requires a double recursive algorithm, (ii) optimization with a molecular clock: a simple recursion with data compression is used in this case, due to the impossibility of computing analytical derivatives.

@item likelihood.recursion_simple.compression = @{simple|recursive@}

Site compression for the simple recursion:
@option{simple}: identical sites are not computed twice, @option{recursive}: look for site patterns to save computation time during optimization, but requires extra time for building the patterns.
This is usually the best option, particularly for nucleotide data sets.

The BppSeqGen program uses the common syntax introduced in the previous section for setting the alphabet, loading the sequences (@pxref{Sequences}) and tree (@pxref{Tree}), specifying the model (@pxref{Model}) and writing sequence data (@pxref{WritingSequences}).


The root sequence can be sampled from the model specification, with
additional argument:

@table @command
@item number_of_sites = @{int>0@}

@end table


Or the root sequence can be built from a file of a sequence:

@table @command

@item input.sequence.file=@{path@}
A sequence is be loaded, from which the simulation will be performed,
or from which a root sequence can be sampled.
(@pxref{Sequences}).

@item input.infos = @{path@}
A info file like the one output by bppML.
The estimated site-specific rates will then be used to simulate the same number of sites as found in the info file, with the corresponding rates.

Specific options are:
@table @command

@item input.tree.check_root = @{boolean@}
Tell if the input tree should be checked regarding to the presence of a root. If set to yes (the default), rooted trees will be unrooted if a homogenous model is used.
If not, a rooted tree will be fitted, which can lead to optimization issues in most cases. Use the non default option with care!

@item asr.method = @{none|marginal@}
Marginal is the only option for now. If set to "none", only nodes frequencies can be output.

@item asr.probabilities = @{boolean@}
Tells if we should output the site specific probabilities in each case.

@item asr.sample = @{boolean@}
Tell if we should sample from the posterior distribution instead of using the maximum probability.

@item asr.sample.number = 10 [[asr.sample=yes]]
Number of sample sequences to output.

@item asr.add_extant = @{boolean@}
Should extant (observed) sequences be added to the output sequence file?
The sequences added are the ones which are used for the actual calculation.
It they contained gaps for instance, and that these have been replaced by the unknown character (N or X for example),
then the sequence with unknown characters will be used.

@item output.sites.file = @{@{path@}|none@}
Alignment information log file (site specific rates, probabilities, etc).

@item output.nodes.file = @{@{path@}|none@}
Ancestral nodes information: expected frequencies (prefix exp) (see Galtier & Gouy
1998) and a posteriori probabilities of ancestral states (prefix eb).

@item output.nodes.add_extant = @{boolean@}
Tell if leaf nodes should be added to the output file.

@section BppMixedLikelihoods: Bio++ Site-Likelihoods Inside Mixed Models.

The BppMixedLikelihoods program uses the common syntax introduced in the previous section for setting the alphabet, loading the sequences (@pxref{Sequences}) and tree (@pxref{Tree}) and specifying the model (@pxref{Model}).

Given a mixed parameter name of mixed model, or a mixed model made of
several models, the BppMixedLikelihoods program computes site per site
log-likelihoods of the several values of the parameter, or of the
several sub-models of the mixture. If the mixed model is built on a
parameter which value follows a distribution, and in an additional
column -- named "mean" -- the a posteriori mean value of the paramater
is computed.

Specific options are:
@table @command

@item output.likelihoods.file = @{@{path@}@}
Ouput file of the program (site specific log-likelihood, and mean of
the mixed parameters, if any).

@item likelihoods.model_number = @{integer@}
In case of a non-homogeneous modeling, the number of the mixed model
which parameter or sub-models are considered.

@item likelihoods.parameter_name = @{string@}
If the considered mixed model is built from a distribution on a
parameter, the name of the parameter to be considered. In this case,
an additional column is written, in which the average a posteriori
value of the parameter is.

@item optimization.method = @{init|pairwise|iterations@}
There are several ways to optimize substitution parameters.
The @option{init} option corresponds to the standard behavior, that is, keeping them to their initial, user-provided value.
The @option{pairwise} option estimate those parameters in a pairwise manner.
This should be avoided, particularly with parameter-rich models.
Finally the @option{iterations} option corresponds to Ninio et al, Bioinformatics (2007) recursive algorithm:
After each distance tree, a global ML estimation of the substitution parameters is performed.
The estimated values are then used to rebuild a distance matrix and a tree.
The algorithm stops when the topology does not change anymore.
The ML optimization uses the parameters described in (@pxref{Estimation}).

@item output.tree.file = @{@{path@}|none@}

The Bio++ Sequence Manipulator convert between various file formats, and can also perform various operations on sequences.
It uses the common options for setting the alphabet, loading the sequences (@pxref{Sequences}) and writing the resulting data set (@pxref{WritingSequences}).
It can use the ``Generic'' option for alphabets if only file format conversion is to be performed, but the correct alphabet must be specified for more advanced manipulations, like in silico molecular biology.

@section BppAlnScore: Bio++ Alignment Scoring

This program compares two alignments and computes column scores.
Scores are output to a text file, and/or can be used to generate
a site selection, to be output in a mase file.

The two input alignments are specified using the input.sequences
procedures (@pxref{Sequences}), with suffixes ``.test'' for the
first one, and ``.ref'' for the second. Scores will be computed 
for each column of the ``.test'' alignment.

Two scores are computed, following work by Thompson (1999):
@table @emph
@item column score (CS)
is 1 if the column is found in the reference alignment, 0 otherwise.
@item sum-of-pairs score (SPS)
is the proportion of pairs of residues which are also aligned in
the reference alignment.
@end table

Specific options:
@table @command

@item output.scores = @{path@}
A text file where scores can be written, one row per column.
If set to 'none', no file will be produced.

@item output.mase = @{path@}
If not 'none', a Mase alignment will be generated, as a copy
of the ``.test'' input alignment, with two sites selections
names CS and SPS.

@item output.sps_thresholds = @{float@}
The threshold to use for generating the site selection based 
on SPS score. All positions with at least the threshold value
will be included in the selection.

@item score.word_size = @{int>0@}
If alignment is for a word alphabet (typically codons), the word
size can be specified in order to produce a compatible site selection.
Please note that in this case, the alignment must not be loaded with
the world alphabet, but the corresponding letter alphabet.

@item score.phase = @{int>0|chars@}
Eather a number (1-based) stating the starting position for words,
or the starting word. In this latter case, the first occurrence of the
word in all sequences will be used to determine the phase.

@section BppTreeDraw: Bio++ Tree Drawing

This is a simple program that outputs a tree in various vector formats.
It takes as input a tree following the standard syntax.

Specific options:
@table @command

@item output.drawing.file = @{path@}
The file where to output the figure.

@item output.drawing.format = @{Svg|Xfig|Inkscape|Pgf@}
The file format.
@item output.drawing.plot = @{plotting algorithm@}
The plotting algorithm can be either Phylogram or Cladogram.
They follow the keyval syntax, with the following arguments:
@end table

@table @option
@item xu, yu @{float@}
The scale units for x and y axis.

@item direction.h @{left2right|right2left@}
Horizontal orientation of the tree plot.

@item direction.v @{top2bottom|bottom2top@}
Vertical orientation of the tree plot.

@item draw.leaves, draw.ids, draw.brlen, draw.bs @{boolean@}
Tell if leaf names, node ids, branch lengths and/or bootstrap should be drawn.
