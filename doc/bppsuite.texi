@node Introduction, Syntax, Top, Top
@chapter Introduction

The Bio++ Program Suite is a package of programs using the Bio++ libraries and dedicated to Phylogenetics and Molecular Evolution.
All programs are independent, but can be combined to perform complex analysis.
These programs use the interface helper tools of the libraries, and hence share the same syntax.
They also have several options in common, which may also be shared by third-party software.
This manual was hence split into three parts: 
@table @emph
@item Bio++ option file syntax
A general description about the language used to interact with the programs.

@item Common options
A more detailed description about several options that are encountered in several programs. This include input/output of data and model specifications.

@item The Bio++ Program Suite reference
Include a program per program reference of all available options.

@end table

@c ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Syntax, Common, Introduction, Top
@chapter Syntax description

@section Calling the programs and writing the option files.

The programs in the Bio++ Program Suite are command line-driven. The arguments may be passed as parameter=value options, either directly to the command line or
using an option file:
@cartouche
@example
@{program@} parameter1=value1 parameter2=value2 ... parameterN=valueN
@end example
@end cartouche
or
@cartouche
@example
@{program@} param=option_file
@end example
@end cartouche
where @{program@} is the name of the program to use (bppml, bppseqgen, etc.).
Option files are a list of parameter=value lines, with only one
parameter per line. They can be written from scratch using a regular text editor, but since these file can potentially turn to be quite complex, it is probably wiser to start with a sample provided along with the program (if any!).

Extra-space may be included between
parameter name, equal sign and value:
@cartouche
@example
first_parameter   = value1
second_parameter  = value2
@end example
@end cartouche
and lines can be broken using the backslash character:
@cartouche
@example
parameter = value1,\
            value2,\
            value3
@end example
@end cartouche

Comment may also be included, in either script format
@cartouche
@example
# This is a comment
@end example
@end cartouche
or C format
@cartouche
@example
/* This is a comment
*/
@end example
@end cartouche
or C++ format
@cartouche
@example
// This is a comment
@end example
@end cartouche
Command line and file options may be combined:
@cartouche
@example
@{program@} param=option_file parameterX=valueX
@end example
@end cartouche
In case of parameterX is specified in both option file and command
line, the command line value will be used.
This allows to run the programs several time by changing a single option,
like the name of the data set for instance.

Option files can be nested, by using param=optionfile within an option file, as with the command line.
It is possible to use this option as often as needed, this will load all the required option files.

@section Different types of options

The next chapters describe the whole set of options available in BppSuite.
The type of parameter value expected is defined as:
@table @command
@item @{chars@}
A character chain

@item @{path@}
A file path, may be absolute or related to the current directory

@item @{int@}
An integer

@item @{int@}, @{int>0@}, @{int>=0@}, @{int[2,10]@}
An integer, a positive integer, a positive non-null integer, an
integer falling between 2 and 10

@item @{real@}, @{real>0@}, etc
A real number, a positive real number, etc.

@item @{boolean@}
A Boolean value, may be one of 'yes', 'no', 'true' or 'false'

@item @{xxx|yyy|zzz@}
A set of allowed values

@item @{list<type>@}
A list of values of specified type, separated by comas.

@end table

If an option availability or choice depends on another parameters, it will be noted as

@example
parameter1=@{xxx|yyy|zzz@}

parameter2=@{chars@} (parameter1=zzz)
@end example
meaning that parameter2 is available only if parameter1 is set to 'zzz'.

Any optional argument will be noted within hooks [].


@section Variables

It is possible to recall anywhere the value of an option by using $(parameter).
@cartouche
@example
optimization.topology.algorithm = NNI
optimization.topology.algorithm_nni.method = phyml
output.tree = MyData_$(optimization.topology.algorithm)_$(optimization.topology.algorithm_nni.method).dnd
@end example
@end cartouche
You can use this syntax to define global variables:
@cartouche
@example
data=MyData
sequence.file=$(data).fasta
input.tree=$(data).dnd
output.infos=$(data).infos
@end example
@end cartouche

Important note: it is not possible to use a macro with the 'param' option.
This is because all nested option files are parsed before the variable resolution.
Writing param=$(model1).bpp will not work, but this allows the user to override variables in nested files, as with the command line.
For instance:
@cartouche
@example
#Option file 1:
param=options2.bpp
sequence.file=$(data).fasta
sequence.format=Fasta
@end example
@end cartouche
@cartouche
@example
#Option file 2:
data=LSU
#etc
@end example
@end cartouche

@end menu

@node Sequences, Tree, Common, Common
@section Setting alphabet and reading sequences

@table @command
@item alphabet = @{DNA|RNA|Protein@}
The alphabet to use when reading sequences.

@item input.sequence.file=@{path@}
The sequence file to use. Depending on the program, these sequences must or do not have to be aligned.

@item input.sequence.format = @{sequence format description@}
The sequence file format.

@end table
Since Bio++ Program Suite version 0.4.0, the format description uses the keyval syntax.
The format is a function, with optional parameters:

@table @command

@item Fasta()
The fasta format.

@item Mase(siteSelection=@{chars@})
The Mase format (as read by Seaview and Phylo_win for instance), with an optional site selection name.

@item Phylip(order=@{interleaved|sequential@}, type=@{classic|extended@}, split=@{spaces|tab@})
The Phylip format, with various variation. The argument @command{order} distinguishes between sequential and interleaved format, while the option @command{type} distinguished between the plain old Phylip format and the more recent extension allowing for sequence names longer than 10 characters, as understood by PAML and PhyML.
Finally, @command{split} specifies the type of character that separates the sequence name from the sequence content. The conventional option is to use one (classic) or more (extended) spaces, but tabs can also be used instead.

@item Clustal(extraSpaces=@{int@})
The Clustal format. In its basic set up, sequence names do not have space characters, and one space splits the sequence content from its name.
The parser can however be configured to allow for spaces in the sequence names, providing a minimum of space is used to split the content form the name.
Setting @command{extraSpaces} to 5 for instance, the sequences are expected to be at least 6 spaces away for their names.

@item Dcse()
The DCSE alignment format. The secondary structure annotation will be ignored.

@end table

For programs that do not require the sequences to be aligned, the following format are also available:
@table @command

@item GenBank()
Very basic support: only retrieves the sequence content for now, all features are ignored.

@end table

Basic operations can be performed on the sequences:

@table @command

@item input.sequence.sites_to_use = @{all|nogap|complete@}
This option only works if the program requires an alignment.
Tells which sites to use.
The @option{nogap} option removes all sites containing at least one
gap, and the @option{complete} option removes all sites containing at
least one gap or one generic character, as 'X' for instance.

@item input.sequence.max_gap_allowed=101%
This option only works if the program requires an alignment.
Only works when the @option{all} option is selected.
specify the maximum amount of gap allowed by site, given as a number
of sequence or a percentage.
Sites not matching the criterion will not be included in the analysis.

@end table
 
@c ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Tree, Model, Sequences, Common
@section Reading trees

@table @command
@item tree.file = @{path@}
The phylogenetic tree file to use.
Branch lengths are optional.
Only newick format is supported for now.

@end table

@c ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node Model, Estimation, Tree, Common
@section Model specification

@table @command
@item nonhomogeneous = @{no|one_per_branch_general@}
Set the type of model. The @option{no} option is used for homogeneous models.
The @option{one_per_branch} option is used as a short cut for setting Galtier and Gouy 97-like branch-specific models, and the @option{general} option for non-stationary and eventually non-homogeneous models.
In either of the last two cases, the model is non-stationary, that is, possibly not at the equilibrium and hence includes the root frequencies as additional parameters. If the substitution model is not the same across the tree, then the model is also non-homogeneous.
@end table

@subsection Specifying the substitution model

@table @command

@item model = @{model description@}
A description of the substitution model to use, in the keyval syntax.

@end table
From version 0.4.0 of BppSuite, the model specification used a completely new syntax, based on the keyval (key = value) scheme. The old option files will hence not be compatible with new version of the software. The new syntax however is hopefully more intuitive, and more generalizable, so that few changes are expected when new models will be built. The substitution model is a function, potentially including parameters. The following table lists the set of usable functions, and their parameters.

@table @command

@item JC69()
The Jukes and Cantor model, for proteins or nucleotide alphabets. This model has no additional parameter.

@item K80(kappa=@{real>0@})
The Kimura 2 parameters model for nucleotides. @var{kappa} is the transition over transversion ratio.

@item F84(kappa=@{real>0@}, theta=@{real]0,1[@}, theta1=@{real]0,1[@}, theta2=@{real]0,1[@}, useObservedFreqs=@{boolean@}, useObservedFreqs.pseudoCount=@{int>0@})
Felsenstein's 1984 substitution model for nucleotides, with transition/transversion ratio and 4 distinct equilibrium frequencies. @var{theta} is the GC content, @var{theta1} is the proportion of G / (G + C) and @var{theta2} is the proportion of A / (A + T or U). The @var{useObservedFreqs} option set the @var{theta}s parameters according to the observed counts in the data set, and @var{useObservedFreqs.pseudoCount} is a quantity, defaulting to 0, that can be used in case some counts are zero, on small data sets for instance.
The corrected values are computed as:
@tex
$$\pi_i = {f_i + \psi \over 4\cdot\psi + \sum_j f_j}$$
@end tex

@item HKY85(kappa=@{real>0@}, theta=@{real]0,1[@}, theta1=@{real]0,1[@}, theta2=@{real]0,1[@}, useObservedFreqs=@{boolean@}, useObservedFreqs.pseudoCount=@{int>0@})
Hasegawa, Kishino and Yano 1985's substitution model for nucleotides. Similar to @command{F84}, but with a different implementation. The @var{kappa} parameter used here is comparable to the one in @command{K80}.

@item T92(kappa=@{real>0@}, theta=@{real]0,1[@}, useObservedFreqs=@{boolean@}, useObservedFreqs.pseudoCount=@{int>0@})
Tamura 1992's model for nucleotides, similar to @command{HKY85}, yet assuming that the frequencies of A = T/U and G = C.

@item TN93(kappa1=@{real>0@}, kappa2=@{real>0@}, theta=@{real]0,1[@}, theta1=@{real]0,1[@}, theta2=@{real]0,1[@}, useObservedFreqs=@{boolean@}, useObservedFreqs.pseudoCount=@{int>0@})
Tamura and Nei 1993's model for nucleotides, similar to @command{HKY85}, but allowing for two distinct transition/transversion ratios.

@item GTR(a=@{real>0@}, b=@{real>0@}, c=@{real>0@}, d=@{real>0@}, e=@{real>0@}, theta=@{real]0,1[@}, theta1=@{real]0,1[@}, theta2=@{real]0,1[@}, useObservedFreqs=@{boolean@}, useObservedFreqs.pseudoCount=@{int>0@})
The General Time-Reversible substitution model for nucleotides. Parameters @var{a}, @var{b}, @var{c}, @var{d}, @var{e} are the entries of the matrix.

@item L95(beta=@{real>0@}, gamma=@{real>0@}, delta=@{real>0@}, theta=@{real]0,1[@}, theta1=@{real]0,1[@}, theta2=@{real]0,1[@}, useObservedFreqs=@{boolean@}, useObservedFreqs.pseudoCount=@{int>0@})
The strand-symmetric model of Lobry 1995, for nucleotides.

@item DSO78()
Protein substitution model, using the dcmutt implementation of Kosiol and Goldamn 2005.

@item JTT92()
Protein substitution model, using the dcmutt implementation of Kosiol and Goldamn 2005.

@item DSO78+F(theta=@{real]0,1[@}, theta1=@{real]0,1[@}, theta2=@{real]0,1[@}, ..., useObservedFreqs=@{boolean@}, useObservedFreqs.pseudoCount=@{int>0@})
Protein substitution model, using the dcmutt implementation of Kosiol and Goldamn 2005 and free equilibrium frequencies. The @var{thetaX} are frequencies parameters, where X is 1 to 19.
Parameter @var{theta1} is the proportion of A, @var{theta2} is the proportion of R over (1-A), @var{theta3} the proportion of N over (1-A-R), etc.

@item JTT92+F(theta=@{real]0,1[@}, theta1=@{real]0,1[@}, theta2=@{real]0,1[@}, ..., useObservedFreqs=@{boolean@}, useObservedFreqs.pseudoCount=@{int>0@})
Protein substitution model, using the dcmutt implementation of Kosiol and Goldamn 2005 and free equilibrium frequencies.

@item Empirical(file=@{path@})
Build a protein substitution model from a file in PAML format.

@item Empirical(file=@{path@}, theta=@{real]0,1[@}, theta1=@{real]0,1[@}, theta2=@{real]0,1[@}, ..., useObservedFreqs=@{boolean@}, useObservedFreqs.pseudoCount=@{int>0@})
Build a protein substitution model from a file in PAML format, and use free equilibrium frequencies.

@item TS98(model=@{model description@}, s1=@{real>0@}, s2=@{real>0@})
Tuffley and Steel 1998's 'covarion' model, taking a nested substitution model as argument for @var{model}. the nested model can be any substitution model for any alphabet.

@item G01(model=@{model description@}, rdist=@{rate distribution description@}, mu=@{real>0@})
Galtier 2001's 'covarion' model, taking a nested substitution model as argument for @var{model} and a rate distribution for parameter @var{rdist} (see below).
The nested model can be any substitution model for any alphabet.

@item RE08(model=@{model description@}, lambda=@{real>0@}, mu=@{real>0@})
Rivas and Eddy 2008's substitution model with gaps, taking a nested substitution model as argument for @var{model}.
Parameter @var{lambda} is the insertion rate, while @var{mu} is the deletion rate.

@end table

It is possible to reduce the parameter space by putting extra constraints on parameters, using for instance
@example
model=TN93(kappa1=1.0,kapp2=kappa1,theta=0.5)
@end example
In that particular case the resulting model is strictly equivalent to the HKY85 model. This syntax however allows to define a larger set of models.


@subsection Setting up non-stationary / non-homogeneous models

You can specify a wide range of non-homogeneous models, by combining different options.

@subsubsection One-per-branch non-homogeneous models

This option share the same parameters as the homogeneous case, since the same kind of model is used for each branch. The additional options are the following:
@table @command

@item nonhomogeneous_one_per_branch.shared_parameters = @{list<chars>@}
List the names of the parameters that are shared by all branches.
In Galtier & Gouy model, that would be @var{T92.kappa}, since only the theta parameter is branch-specific.

@end table

@subsubsection General non-homogeneous models

Bio++ provides a general syntax to specify almost any non-homogeneous model.

@table @command

@item nonhomogeneous.number_of_models = @{int>0@}
Set the number of distinct models to use.

@end table

You now have to configure each model individually, using the syntax introduced for the homogeneous case, excepted that model will be numbered, for instance:

@example
model1 = T92(theta=0.39, kappa=2.79)
@end example

The additional option is available to attach the model to branches in the tree, specified by the id of the upper node in the tree:

@table @command

@item model1.nodes_id = 1,5,10:15,19
Specify the ids of the nodes to which the node is attached.
Id ranges can be specified using the @option{begin:end} syntax.

@end table

You can also make a given model share parameters with another one by writing for instance:
@example
model2 = T92(theta=0.39, kappa=model1.T92.kappa)
@end example
Please watch out the syntax, parameters are referred to as [model name].[parameter name] in that case.

Finally, you may find useful the following options:

@table @command

@item output.tree.path = @{@{path@}|none@}
A tree file in newick format, with node ids instead of bootstrap
values, and leaf names with their id as suffix.
The use of that option will cause the program to exit just after producing the tagged tree.

@end table

@subsubsection Root frequencies

As since version 0.4.0, BppSuite uses the keyval syntaxe to set up root frequencies,
@table @command
@item nonhomogeneous.root_freq=@{description of frequency set@}
@end table
The following functions are available:

@table @command

@item Balanced()
Set all the frequencies to 1/size of the alphabet.

@item BalancedGC()
For nucleotides only, set the G content equal to the C content equal to 0.5.

@item Observed()
Set frequencies equal to their values in the data set.

@item ObservedGC()
Does the same as @command{Observed} for the GC content.

@item Init(ancA=@{real]0,1[@}, ancC=@{real]0,1[@}, ..., ancA=@{real]0,1[@}, ancR=@{real]0,1[@}, ancN=@{real]0,1[@})
Allows you to set the values of the frequencies by hand.

@item Init(ancTheta=@{real]0,1[@})
Allows you to set the GC content by hand.

@end table


@subsection Rate across site distribution

From version 0.4.0, BppSuite uses the keyval syntax for specifying rate distributions.

@table @command

@item rate_distribution = @{rate distribution description@}
Specify the rate across sites distribution.

@end table

the following distributions are currently available:

@table @command

@item Uniform()
Uses a constant rate across sites.

@item Gamma(n=@{int>=2@}, alpha=@{float>0@})
A gamma discretized distribution of rates, with @var{n} classes, and a given shape.

@item Invariant(dist=@{rate distribution description@}, p=@{real[0,1]@})
A composite distribution llowing a special class of invariant site, with a probability @var{p}.

@end table

values)

@item
Parameters of the rate distribution (shape parameter of the gamma law, proportion of invariant sites).

@end itemize

@table @command

@item optimization = @{boolean@}
Tells if numerical parameters should be estimated.
Topology estimation is not supported.

@item optimization.method=@{DB|fullD@}
The optimization method to use.
DB (default) uses derivatives-based optimization for branch lengths + Brent for
other parameters, and the fullD options uses derivatives for all parameters, with numerical derivatives for non-branch lengths parameters.

@item optimization_DB.nstep=@{int>=1@}
Number of progressive steps to perform during optimization.
If @option{nstep=3} and @option{precision=E-6}, a first optimization with @option{precision = E-2}, will be performed, then a round with @option{precision} set to E-4 and
finally @option{precision} will be set to E-6. This approach generally saves
significant computation time.

@item optimization.method.derivatives = @{newton|gradient@}
Derivatives-based algorithm to use.
The Newton algorithm uses derivatives up to the second order, and is the recommended choice.
The gradient algorithm uses only first order derivatives and can also be used.

@item optimization.final = @{powell|simplex@}
Optional final optimization step, useful if numerical derivatives are to be used.
Leave the field empty in order to skip this step.

@item optimization.profiler = @{@{path@}|std|none@}
A file where to dump optimization steps (a file path or std for
standard output or none for no output).

@item optimization.message_handler = @{@{path@}|std|none@}
A file where to dump warning messages.

@item optimization.max_number_f_eval = @{int<0@}
The maximum number of likelihood evaluation to perform.

@item optimization.ignore_parameter = @{list<chars>@}
A list of parameters to ignore during the estimation process. The parameter name should include there "namespace", that is their model name, for instance K80.kappa, TN93.theta, GTR.a, Gamma.alpha, etc.
For nested model, the syntax is the following: G01.Gamma.alpha, TS98.T92.kappa, RE08.lamba, RE08.G01.GTR.a, etc. 'Ancient' will ignore all parameters in the ancestral frequency set (non-homogeneous models), and 'BrLen' will ignore all branch lengths.

@item optimization.tolerance = @{float>0@}
The precision on the log-likelihood to reach.

@item output.tree.file = @{@{path@}|none@}
File path where to write the optimized tree.

@item output.infos = @{@{path@}|none@}
A text file containing several statistics for each site in the
alignment.
These statistics include posterior rate, rate class with maximum
posterior probability and whether the site is conserved or not.

@end table

@c ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@node WritingSequences,  , Estimation, Common
@section Writing sequences/alignments to files

@table @command

@item output.sequence.file = @{path@}
The output file where to write the sequences.

@item output.sequence.format = @{sequence format description@}
The output file format, using the same syntaxe as for reading (@pxref{Sequences}).
Only formats Fasta, Mase and Phylip are supported for writing.
In addition, most of the formats support the @command{length} argument, that specifies the maximum number of sequence characters to output on each line (default set to 100).

@section BppML: Bio++ Maximum Likelihood

The BppML program uses the common syntax introduced in the previous section for setting the alphabet, loading the sequences (@pxref{Sequences}), specifying the model (@pxref{Model}), and estimating parameters (@pxref{Estimation}).

The BppML program allows you to optimize tree topologies and perform a bootstrap analysis.

@subsection Topology optimization

@table @command

@item init.tree = @{user|random@}
Set the method for the initial tree to use. @option{user} allows you to use an existing file using the method described in the Common options section. This file may have been built using another method like neighbor joining or parsimony for instance. @option{random} picks a random tree, which is handy to test convergence. This may however slows down significantly the optimization process.

@item init.brlen.method = @{input|equal|clock|grafen@}
Set how to initialize the branch lengths. @option{input}: keep initial branch lengths as is. @option{equal}: put all branch lengths to the same value. @option{clock}: coerce to a clock tree. @option{grafen}: uses Grafen's method to compute branch lengths.
In Grafen's method, all node is given a weight equal to the number of underlying leaves. The length of each branch is then computed as the difference of the weights of the connected nodes, and further divided by the number of leaves in the tree. The height of all nodes are then raised to the power of 'rho', a user specified value. The tree is finally scaled to match a given total height. A value of rho=0 provides a star tree, and the greater the value of rho, the more recent the inner nodes. 

@item init.brlen.method_equal.value = @{real@} (init.brlen.method = equal)
The value for the @option{equal} option.

@item init.brlen.method_grafen.height = @{@{real>0@}|input@} (init.brlen.method = grafen)
The height of the tree for Grafen's method (input for using the current height of the tree)
@item init.brlen.method_grafen.rho = @{real>0@}
Grafen's power parameter.

@item optimization.topology = @{boolean@}
Enable the tree topology estimation.

@item optimization.topology.algorithm = @{NNI@}
Algorithm to use for topology estimation: only NNI available for now.

@item optimization.topology.algorithm_nni.method = @{fast|better|phyml@}
Set the NNI method to use.
@option{fast}: test sequentially all NNI, if a NNI improving the likelihood is found, it is performed.
@option{better}: test all possible NNIs, do the one with the biggest likelihood increase.
@option{phyml}: test all possible NNIs, try doing all the improving ones. If the final likelihoods is better, perform all NNIs. Otherwise, try to do half of them, and so on. 
In most cases the @option{phyml} option shows the best performance.

@item optimization.topology.nstep = @{int>0@}
Number of phyml topology movement steps before re-optimizing parameters.

@item optimization.topology.numfirst = @{boolean@}
Shall we estimate parameters before looking for topology movements?

@item optimization.topology.tolerance.before = @{real>0@}
Tolerance for the prior-topology estimation.
The tolerance numbers should not be too low, in order to save computation time and also for a better topology estimation.
The @option{optimization.tolerance} parameter will be used for the final optimization of numerical parameters (see Common options).

@item optimization.topology.tolerance.during = 100
Tolerance for the during-topology estimation

@item optimization.scale_first = no
Shall we first scale the tree before optimizing parameters? [deprecated]

@subsection Output results

@table @command

@item output.tree.file = @{@{path@}|none@}
Should we write the resulting tree? none or file name.

@item output.infos = @{@{path@}|none@}

@item bootstrap.output.file = @{@{path@}|none@}
Where to write the resulting trees (multi-trees newick format).

@end table

@subsection Rather technical options

Theses options are mainly for debugging or testing purpose, in most case you will be happy with the default setting.

@table @command

@item likelihood.recursion = @{simple|double@}
Set the type of likelihood recursion to use.
@option{simple}: derivatives take more time to compute, but likelihood computation is faster. For big data sets, it can save a lot of memory usage too, particularly when the data are compressed.
@option{double}: uses more memory and need more time to compute likelihood, due to the double recursion. Analytical derivatives are however faster to compute. This option has no effect in the following cases: (i) topology estimation: this requires a double recursive algorithm, (ii) optimization with a molecular clock: a simple recursion with data compression is used in this case, due to the impossibility of computing analytical derivatives.

@item likelihood.recursion_simple.compression = @{simple|recursive@}

Site compression for the simple recursion:
@option{simple}: identical sites are not computed twice, @option{recursive}: look for site patterns to save computation time during optimization, but requires extra time for building the patterns. This is usually the best option, particularly for nucleotide data sets.

@item optimization.method = @{init|pairwise|iterations@}
There are several way to optimize substitution parameters.
The @option{init} option corresponds to the standard behavior, that is keep them to their initial, user-provided value.
The @option{pairwise} option estimate those parameters in a pairwise manner. This should be avoided, particularly with parameter-rich models.
Finally the @option{iterations} option corresponds to Ninio et al, Bioinformatics (2007) recursive algorithm:
After each distance tree, a global ML estimation of the substitution parameters is performed.
The estimated values are then used to rebuild a distance matrix and a tree.
The algorithm stops when the topology does not change anymore.
The ML optimization uses the parameters described in (@pxref{Estimation}).

@section BppSeqMan: Bio++ Sequence Manipulation

The Bio++ Sequence Manipulator convert between various file formats, and can also perform various operations on sequences.
It uses the common options for setting the alphabet, loading the sequences (@pxref{Sequences}) and writing the resulting data set (@pxref{WritingSequences}).
It can use the ``Generic'' option for alphabets if only file format conversion is to be performed, but the correct alphabet must be specified for more advanced manipulations, like in silico molecular biology.

BppSeqMan can perform any number of elementary operation, in any order, providing the output of operation n is compatible with input of operation n+1, and that the input of operation 1 is compatible with the input data.

Specific options:
@table @command

@item sequence.manip = @{list<string>@}
The list, in appropriate order, of elementary operations to perform.
See below for a list of these operations.
@end table

@table @option
@item complement (alphabet = DNA | RNA)

@item transcript (alphabet = DNA | RNA)
Convert to the complementary sequence, switching the type of alphabet (DNA<->RNA).

@item switch (alphabet = DNA | RNA)
Change the alphabet type (DNA<->RNA).

@item translate (alphabet = DNA | RNA)
Convert to proteins. You have to specify a genetic code, see specific options.

@item invert
Invert the sequence 5' <-> 3' or N <-> C

@item remove_gaps
Remove all gaps in sequences (ie, 'unalign')

Change gaps to fully unresolved characters, N for nucleotides and X for proteins.

@item unknown2gap
Change (partially) unresolved characters to gaps.

@item resolve_dotted (Aligned sequences)
Convert a human-readable alignment to a machine-readable alignment.
This manipulation must be first if it is used, and the data must be load with the @option{Generic} alphabet.

@item keep_complete (Aligned sequences)
Keep only complete sites, ie sites without any gap. Sites with unresolved characters are not removed.
It is also possible to fix a maximum proportion of gaps, see specific options.
